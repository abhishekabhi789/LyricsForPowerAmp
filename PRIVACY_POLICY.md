# Privacy Policy

*Lyrics for Poweramp* ("the App") is a lyrics plugin designed for use with the Poweramp music
player. This privacy policy explains how the App handles user data.

## **Data Collection**

The App does not collect, store, or process any personal data from users. Any user configurations in
the App are stored locally on the user's device.

## **Data Usage**

The App uses the [LRCLIB API](https://lrclib.net/docs) to fetch lyrics for tracks played in
Poweramp.

- **Metadata Sharing:** Only track metadata (e.g., track title, artist, album name, and duration) is
  shared with LRCLIB during operation, solely to retrieve lyrics relevant to the track being played.
- **Manual Search:** When performing manual searches, user-provided input (e.g., custom search
  terms) is sent to LRCLIB to fetch lyrics.
- **Purpose of Data:** Any data collected from Poweramp or entered by the user is used exclusively
  to fetch lyrics. No other usage or processing occurs.

## **Data Sharing**

The App does not share any user information with third parties. However:

- Track metadata or user-provided search queries are sent to LRCLIB to retrieve lyrics results.
- Retrieved lyrics are shared only with Poweramp.

## **Security**

While the App does not collect or store personal data, all track metadata and user-provided queries
sent to LRCLIB are transmitted securely over HTTPS to ensure confidentiality and security.

## **User Rights**

Since the App does not collect or store personal data:

- No data deletion or retrieval requests are required or applicable.
- No data retention policies apply.

## **Permissions**

The App requires the following permissions to function:

- **Internet:** To fetch lyrics from the LRCLIB API.
- **Notification:** To inform users about the status of lyrics requests.

These permissions are used solely for the App's functionality and are not used to collect or
transmit user data.

## **Children's Privacy**

The App is not directed at individuals under the age of 18.  
Although the App does not collect data, it relies on third-party services (e.g., LRCLIB), which may
deliver lyrics containing unpleasant or explicit words. Therefore, the App is not recommended for
users under the age of 18.

## **Changes to This Policy**

This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the Appâ€™s features or to
comply with legal requirements.
